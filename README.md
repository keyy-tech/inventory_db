## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure MongoDB Connection

Open the `db_connection.py` file and update it with your MongoDB connection URI:

```python
MONGO_URI = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

Make sure MongoDB is running and accessible.

### 4. Run Migrations (if applicable)

If you use any relational parts like sessions or auth, run:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit your API at:  
üìç `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## üîÅ Using the API with Postman

### 1. Import the Postman Collection

1. Open Postman.
2. Click on **File** > **Import**.
3. Select the file `Inventory.postman_collection.json` located in the project directory.
4. Click **Import**.
